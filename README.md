**🧙‍♂️ GoDaijishou Xposed Module Project.**

루팅된 LG Wing 스마트폰의 세컨드 런처 화면의 홈을 다이지쇼를 후킹해주는 Xposed 모듈입니다.

This Xposed module is designed for rooted LG Wing smartphones.

Its purpose is to intercept and modify the behavior of the second launcher's home screen.

Instead of launching the default LG second launcher, it redirects the home action to open Daijishou, an alternative launcher application.

This module utilizes the Xposed framework to achieve this functionality, allowing for system-level modifications without altering the original system files.
